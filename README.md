## Git та GitHub

I’ve already had a little knowledge about working with GIT. But it was also useful to recall in memory different GIT commands and also to learn new commands such as ‘cherry-pick’ or ‘tag’. This course and game helped me easily understand and learn the main aspects of VCS.

1.)Version Control with Git:

## Task_linux_cli

1.

This lesson made me acquainted with Linux, command line, and HTTP tools.
Linux Survival is a fascinating site for studying Linux. All information is structured and easily explained.
Also want to notice articles about HTTP tools. I covered the complex aspects of how HTTP works: connection implementation, identification/authentication, and hashing. And I got a good idea about the variety of issues solved by the HTTP protocol.

## Git Collaboration

The same work with GIT. Unfortunately, I mistakenly confused something, when I did the first lesson with GIT ((( So,I passed the required tasks when I completed the levels for the first time.


## Intro to HTML and CSS

I’ve updated my knowledge about HTML and CSS.  I took the course about it and also solve different tasks on this topic. In my opinion, the materials provided by the course are very structured and there is nothing superfluous in them.

## Responsive Web Design


As always the lesson was so absorbing.  I’ve been following this YouTube channel for a long time and can confidently say, that blogger is one of my favorite YouTubers on this theme. Also, I can't miss the presented games for passing, it's very cool when you can learn while playing!

## JS Basics


All I can say is that it was difficult, but nothing is impossible. Having also reviewed additional materials, I decided to read the book You Don't Know JS Yet: Get Started - 2nd Edition.
