##Git та GitHub

I’ve already had a little knowledge about working with GIT. But it was also useful to recall in memory different GIT commands and also to learn new commands such as ‘cherry-pick’ or ‘tag’. This course and game helped me easily understand and learn the main aspects of VCS.

##Task_linux_cli

1.

This lesson made me acquainted with Linux, command line, and HTTP tools in this lesson.
Linux Survival is a fascinating site for studying Linux. All information is structured and easily explained.
Also want to notice articles about HTTP tools. I covered the complex aspects of how HTTP works: connection implementation, identification/authentication, and hashing. And I got a good idea about the variety of issues solved by the HTTP protocol.
